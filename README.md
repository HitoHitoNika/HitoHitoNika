## What can you find here ?

On my GitHub profile, you will primarily find private projects and school assignments that I am happy to share. These projects allow me to further develop my skills and explore new technologies.

I am excited about the opportunity to connect with other developers and learn from their experiences. Therefore, I am always open to collaborations and feedback on my projects. If you are interested in my work or have any questions, please feel free to contact me.
